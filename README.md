# Movie Bee - Client

## Objective

This project aims to build the client side for the Movie Bee application using React. The client interacts with the existing server-side code (REST API and database) to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Features

### User Authentication
- Login and Registration interfaces integrated with the REST API.
- Secure storage of user credentials using tools like JWT or OAuth.

### Movie Browsing and Search
- Movies can be displayed in a responsive grid or list format.
- Search movies by title or genre.

### User Profiles
- Users can update personal information.
- Ability to add or remove movies from a "Favorites" list.
- User can deregister from the application.

### Movie Details View
- Detailed information about each movie (e.g., genre, director, release information, and storyline).
- Interactive features like adding movies to the favorites list.
